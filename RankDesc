A travel agency is promoting activities for a "Summer Christmas" party.
They want to identify the top 2 activities based on the average rating. Write a query to rank the activities by average rating.

WITH cte AS (
    SELECT 
        A.activity_name AS activity_name, 
        AVG(AR.rating) AS avg_rating
    FROM 
        activities A
    INNER JOIN 
        activity_ratings AR 
    ON 
        A.activity_id = AR.activity_id
    GROUP BY 
        A.activity_name
),
cte2 AS (
    SELECT 
        activity_name, 
        avg_rating,
        RANK() OVER (ORDER BY avg_rating DESC) AS Rnk
    FROM 
        cte
)
SELECT
    activity_name
FROM 
    cte2
ORDER BY 
    Rnk
LIMIT 2
