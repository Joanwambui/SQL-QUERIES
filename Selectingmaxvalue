Scientists are studying the diets of polar bears. Write a query to find the maximum amount of food (in kilograms) consumed by each polar bear in a single meal December 2024.
Include the bear_name and biggest_meal_kg, and sort the results in descending order of largest meal consumed.

WITH cte AS (
    SELECT 
        P.bear_name, 
        M.food_weight_kg, 
        M.date
    FROM polar_bears P
    INNER JOIN meal_log M
    ON P.bear_id = M.bear_id
)

SELECT 
    bear_name, 
    MAX(food_weight_kg) AS max_food_weight
FROM cte
WHERE strftime('%Y-%m', date) = '2024-12'
GROUP BY bear_name
ORDER BY max_food_weight DESC
